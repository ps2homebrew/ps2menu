PS2MENU is a Hard Drive project meant at start to offer hdd booting that dms3 had, on a no-mod or other ps2

Todo:

- More improved visuals
- Partitioning/Formatting PS2 HDD functions
- Support for both memory card slots
- Support for copying between HDD partitions
	The two above are likely to require a complete rewrite of PS2MENU
	which is something currently in the pipeline.
