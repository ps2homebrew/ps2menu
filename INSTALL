You need CVS PS2ETH, LWIP (062 Tag), PS2LIB, PS2DRV, libhdd, bin2s, MrBrown's sbv-1.0-lite,
libito 0.2.1 and libcdvd 1.15 to compile this.

We recommend a full working PS2 toolchain to build this, with fully
functional EE-GCC and IOP-GCC compilers. Mainly so you are able to build
the above requirements from the latest sources at cvs.ps2dev.org.
However, this program builds to just a single EE executable elf.

bin2s ( download from www.thethirdcreation.net/tools/bin2s.c )

type "make" in the root folder of ps2menu to build it yourself.
A successful build will create the executable ./ps2menu/bin/ps2menu.elf

You need these IRX's when compiling
-filexio.irx	(PS2DRV)
-iomanx.irx		(PS2DRV)
-ps2dev9.irx	(PS2DRV)
-ps2atad.irx	(PS2DRV)
-iuntar.irx		(PS2DRV)
-fakehost.irx	(PS2DRV)
-ps2netfs.irx	(PS2DRV)
-poweroff.irx	(LIBHDD)
-ps2fs.irx		(LIBHDD)
-ps2hdd.irx		(LIBHDD)
-ps2ip.irx		(LWIP_062)
-ps2smap.irx	(PS2ETH)
-cdvd.irx		(LIBCDVD)

You need these libs when compiling
-libmc.a		(PS2LIB)
-libpad.a		(PS2LIB)
-libhdd.a		(LIBHDD)
-libfileXio.a	(PS2DRV)
-libsbv_patches.a (sbv-1.0-lite)
-libcdvdfs.a	(LIBCDVD)
-libkernel.a	(PS2LIB)
-libito.a		(LIBITO)

Most of these library packages can be downloaded from http://cvs.ps2dev.org/
sbv-1.0-lite is available from Marcus Brown's site http://www.0xd6.org/
libITO is available from http://www.mouthshut.net/ (The makefile supplied with this
library was changed to build with the '-G0' option).
