Version 1.0
PS2MENU is a Hard Drive project meant at start to offer hdd booting that dms3 had, on a no-mod or other ps2

Left and Right : Move down ten files
x              : On host: you can copy files over or untar/gzip a file into the root directory
	       : On pfs0: runs the elf or opens folder
Up and Down    : Move up and down the files
Circle         : Delete file or empty folder - prompts for confirmation
Square         : Create folder
Tiangle	       : On pfs checks to see if is a valid ELF and will load it. If not you can select a differnt ELF
L1             : Switch partion/volume
R1	       : Switch from running hard drive programs to host to hard drive copy



To transfer files you need a list similar to this

C:\ps2\random.elf
C:\ps2\random.irx

"dir *.elf /b /s >elflist.txt" will create this. Put the list where the elf is booting from.

Boots only from PS2Link at the moment because we need host: 
Will boot from memory card (without copy from host support) If loading as the exploit, PS2MENU.ELF should be
renamed to BOOT.ELF.
