PS2MENU is a Hard Drive project meant at start to offer hdd booting that dms3 had, on a no-mod or other ps2

Left and Right : Changes from host: to pfs0: and back
x              : On host: you can copy files over on pfs0: runs the elf or opens folder
Up and Down    : Guess
Circle         : Delete file or empty folder - prompts for confirmation
Square         : Create folder
L1             : Switch partion/volume



To transfer files you need a list similar to this

"C:\ps2\random.elf"

"dir *.elf /b /s >elflist.txt" will create this. Put the list where the elf is booting from.

Boots only from PS2Link at the moment because of the need of host: 
Will boot from memory card (without copy from host support) so long as required ELF and IRX
files are included in the same folder. If loading as the exploit, PS2MENU.ELF should be
renamed to BOOT.ELF.
