Version 2.1

PS2MENU is a Hard Drive project, born from mcbootloader and PS2 Independence MC loader,
meant at start to offer hdd booting similar to that of dms3, on a no-mod or other ps2.

This program relies heavily on the PS2 libraries developed at ps2dev.org amongst other
sources. Much appreciation and thanks go to all those responsible, these include (in no
particular order) Karmix, csh, Pukko, Oobles, Sjeep, Hiryu, MrBrown, adresd, Jum, and
everybody else who has offered help, advice and inspiration on irc #ps2dev.

To transfer files from host: you need a list similar to this in a text file 'elflist.txt'

C:\ps2\random.elf
C:\ps2\random.irx

"dir *.elf /b /s >elflist.txt" will create this. The program will look for this file in
the folder ps2menu.elf was executed from.

Will boot from memory card (without copy from host support) If loading as the exploit,
PS2MENU.ELF should be renamed to BOOT.ELF.
